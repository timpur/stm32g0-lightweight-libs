# STM32G0 LightWeight Libs

This repo is intended to be checked out as the lib dir in your platform io project.

These libs have be highly cut or optimised for STM32 Arduino on small flash storage.

## Libs:

### TinyWire

This lib is meant to replace Wire from the core as a cut impmentation to support the bare min for I2C coms.

### IFloat

Since the STM32G0 Arm M0+ cores dont have an fpu, relying on c software float maths consume a huge amount of ram.

This the `I` in `IFloat` means integer based maths.

This is not a 1:1 replacement for floats and is a hack really.

The idea here is to have a presision like 2 dp expressed as 10^exponent. So your dp resolution is a fixed.

### IC2 Libs

The libs are not complete and do not offer configuring the sensor entirely and have fixed defaults by defalt for size reasons.

- APDS9930: Bare min to get the Proximity data
- SHT4x: Bare min to get the Temp and Humidity data
